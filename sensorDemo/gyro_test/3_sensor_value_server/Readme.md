## Testing zmq communication in python

Demo programs for an Dreamland speed sensor value server

Example code I wrote using ideas from ([this website](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2012/01/04/shared-counter-with-pythons-multiprocessing)) and using the zmq documentation about [shared arrays](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Array).

There are several files here, use the latest version.

This code is still in development, and may not work.
