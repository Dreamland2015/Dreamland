## Accelerometer connection demo for Raspberry Pi

Files for reading accelerometer data with a Raspberry Pi (version B+ or 2B)
from a connected MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyro breakout board

Testing getting useable values from the sensor.

Doesn't work yet. But there are running demo/test programs that I'm working on.
Descriptions are in the headers of most files.
