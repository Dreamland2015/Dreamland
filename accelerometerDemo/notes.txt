Currently the RPi runs python 2.
One issue with python 3 is that installation of the smbbus is not easy (in python 2 one can just use apt-get), and a bit more involved (manual download and compilation). We need smbbus to read values from the MPU-6050 gyro/accelerometer.

To install the zmq messaging system, run:
sudo apt-get install python-zmq
